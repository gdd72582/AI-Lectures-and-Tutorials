# AI Lecture and Tutorials

> Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Course (2025)

This repository contains assignments and exercises completed during a 2025 undergraduate course on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Each task focuses on building a solid understanding of core ML concepts through both theory and implementation.  
Using libraries like PyTorch and Scikit-learn, topics range from basic classification to deep learning with CNNs.

Assignments are organized by topic and model type, and include:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Neural network architectures (MLP, CNN)  
- Comparative experiments and performance analysis
